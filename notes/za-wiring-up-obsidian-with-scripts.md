# Wiring up Obsidian with scripts

Recommended setup: use the Obsidian **Shell commands** community plugin.

The plugin can run system commands from Obsidian's command palette or hotkeys. Use only trusted commands because these scripts can create and modify vault files.

The commands and script names below illustrate the full working-vault workflow. The scripts are not included in this reduced public repository.

## Important detail

`new-note.sh` and `new-moc.sh` are interactive scripts. They use terminal prompts, so they should be launched in a terminal window rather than run silently in the background.

## Linux examples

Replace `/path/to/your/vault` with the path to the Obsidian vault.

For GNOME Terminal:

```bash
gnome-terminal --working-directory=/path/to/your/vault -- bash -lc './scripts/new-note.sh; echo; read -rp "Press Enter to close..."'
```

```bash
gnome-terminal --working-directory=/path/to/your/vault -- bash -lc './scripts/new-moc.sh; echo; read -rp "Press Enter to close..."'
```

For KDE Konsole:

```bash
konsole --workdir /path/to/your/vault -e bash -lc './scripts/new-note.sh; echo; read -rp "Press Enter to close..."'
```

## Obsidian setup

1. Install the community plugin `Shell commands`.
2. Enable it.
3. Open Shell Commands settings.
4. Add a command named `Vault: New classified note`.
5. Paste the terminal command that runs `scripts/new-note.sh`.
6. Add a command named `Vault: New MOC`.
7. Paste the terminal command that runs `scripts/new-moc.sh`.
8. Open `Settings > Hotkeys`.
9. Search for the shell command names.
10. Bind `Ctrl+N` to `Vault: New classified note`.
11. Bind `Ctrl+M` to `Vault: New MOC`.

If `Ctrl+N` is already assigned to Obsidian's built-in new note command, remove or change that binding first.

## Noninteractive scripts

Noninteractive scripts can be wired directly as command-palette actions:

```bash
/path/to/your/vault/scripts/check-vault.sh
```

Examples:

- `scripts/check-vault.sh`
- `scripts/find-classification.sh`
- `scripts/list-unlinked-notes.sh`
- `scripts/triage-uncategorized.sh`

Keep `new-note.sh` and `new-moc.sh` terminal-based unless they are later rewritten to accept command-line arguments or use GUI prompts.
